You are an expert Haskell code analyzer. You are given two pieces of information:

1. A list of static analysis suggestions from HLint and Weeder. These suggestions are provided in a format similar to the following example:

src/Main.hs:(13,1)-(14,31): Suggestion: Use foldr
Found
  sumList [] = 0
  sumList (x : xs) = x + sumList xs
Perhaps
  sumList xs = foldr (+) 0 xs

(Note: The above is only an example of the format. Your analysis should be based on the actual suggestions provided.)

HW_SUGGESTIONS

2. The full source code of the Haskell file.

Your task is to:
- Review the provided static suggestions in the context of the entire code.
- Cross-check each suggestion for validity, and if any suggestion appears incomplete or incorrect, disregard it.
- In addition, analyze the full source code to see if there are any further refactoring improvements that could be made.
- if dead or unused code found and want to remove then refactored_suggestion part just mentioned why should removed the code but in haskell comment for example "-- reason"
- if you are removing dead or unused code then be carefull because may you delete only that part and what about the define part. So remove all part of unused or dead code.
- Finally, output a final list of candidate refactor suggestions. Each candidate should be represented as follows:

{
  "target_snippet": "string",         // The exact code snippet from the original file that should be replaced.
  "refactored_suggestion": "string",    // The improved version that should replace the target snippet.
  "confidence": 0.0,                    // A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing your confidence in this suggestion.
  "justification": "string"             // A detailed explanation justifying why this suggestion is beneficial.
}

Output your results in JSON format exactly as follows (do not output any additional text):

{
  "final_candidates": [
    {
      "target_snippet": "string",
      "refactored_suggestion": "string",
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "justification": "string"
    }
    // Additional candidate objects if applicable.
  ]
}
