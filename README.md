# Intelligent Haskell Code Refactoring

A multi-agent system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent, automated refactoring of Haskell code. This project is based on the research paper:

**LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Refactoring of Haskell Code**  
by Siddeeq et al. ([arXiv 2506.19481v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19481))

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project introduces a fully automated, multi-agent framework that applies LLMs to refactor Haskell programs with minimal developer intervention. Key goals include:

- Reducing code complexity
- Improving runtime performance
- Optimizing memory usage
- Enhancing code readability and maintainability

## ðŸ§  System Architecture

The framework employs four specialized LLM-powered agents:

1. **Code Analysis Agent (CAA):** Identifies refactoring opportunities.
2. **Code Refactoring Agent (CRA):** Transforms the code using learned strategies.
3. **Verification Agent (VA):** Ensures semantic correctness using tests and formal checks.
4. **Debugging Agent (DA):** Automatically fixes any introduced issues.

Agents communicate asynchronously and iteratively refine the output until desired improvements are achieved.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

Evaluated across multiple real-world Haskell projects, the system achieved:

- ðŸ”» 9â€“14% reduction in cyclomatic complexity
- ðŸš€ 5â€“50% faster runtime
- ðŸ’¾ 14â€“21% reduction in memory usage
- ðŸ§¼ 25% fewer HLint suggestions
- âœ… 30% fewer GHC warnings

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GPT-Laboratory/Intelligent-Haskell-Code-Refactoring.git
   cd Intelligent-Haskell-Code-Refactoring
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Setup Backend Script**:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
2. **Setup Frontend Panel**:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm run start
   ```
